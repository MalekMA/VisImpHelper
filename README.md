## Capstone project

In todayâ€™s world, many technological advancements have been made to improve the lives of those suffering from disabilities or impairment, however, there has not been any significant, affordable products made for those who are visually impaired. We developed a mobile companion app which will try and improve the day-to-day lives of those suffering from visual impairments.

Our app, combined with traditional ways visually impaired people get around such as the white cane and guide dog, aims to enhance the lives of those individuals by providing features that allow them to complete tasks they would not be able to complete without it. These features include: identifying objects, reading printed or handwritten text and saving the text, an obstacle avoidance system, live environment analysis for dangerous elements, live directions to address, saving voice notes, calling, SMS, and contacting emergency.

 The user experience was designed and tailored specifically for those who are visually impaired such that the main interface only has one large button which the user clicks to initiate the command system. All commands are entered through speech, and all responses are given via speech.

Our process for developing our application was putting ourselves in the position of those are who visually impaired, and trying to think of features which would prove to be useful for our target user base then combining all of the features into one easy-to-use package.

In the end, we were able to develop a prototype which met the majority of our requirements: a responsive app which provides constant speech feedback that does not consume a lot of battery or mobile data, and improves the day-to-day lives of visually impaired individuals with the use of our built-in features.
